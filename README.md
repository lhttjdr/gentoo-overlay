# Gentoo Overlay
A gentoo overlay for myself.
- When I find some outdated ebuild with invalid URL or other parameters, I will add it to my overlay.
- When I want to use some pacakges not in official overlay, usually I will search for an ebuild written by someone. Because I do not want to add lots of personal overlay, I will move the ebuild into my overlay.
I move my local overlay to Github, only because I have several Gentoo computers.
